# Version Control

- If the project isn't in a git repo, STOP and ask permission to initialize one.
- YOU MUST STOP and ask how to handle uncommitted changes or untracked files when starting work. Suggest committing existing work first.
- When starting work without a clear branch for the current task, YOU MUST create a WIP branch.
- YOU MUST TRACK all non-trivial changes in git.
- YOU MUST commit frequently throughout the development process, even if your high-level tasks are not yet done. Commit your journal entries.
- NEVER SKIP, EVADE OR DISABLE A PRE-COMMIT HOOK
- NEVER use `git add -A` unless you've just done a `git status` - Don't add random test files to the repo.
- Be sure to commit all feature development on a "feature" branch AND ask before pushing code to the `main` or `master` branch.
- **NEVER commit directly to the `main` or `master` branch without explicit permission from Mark.** Always use a feature branch and submit a PR.
